#Shopping Management System

This Shopping Management System is based on a project originally developed by the creator of the YouTube tutorial available at the following link: https://youtu.be/kIOTtRf9Drk?si=o4RBKqh1mzTr9Wuq . I do not claim full ownership of the original code. All rights and credit go to the original developer. However, I have added new features and improved functionalities to enhance the project’s performance and user experience.

To set up and run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Install XAMPP from the official website if you haven’t already.

Open phpMyAdmin by visiting http://localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser.

Import the provided SQL database file into phpMyAdmin to create the required database [named as shopping_mart.sql]

Copy the entire project folder and paste it into the htdocs directory inside your XAMPP installation folder (usually found at C:\xampp\htdocs).

Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for customization and code editing.

To launch the project in your browser, copy the path of the index.php file from the project folder and paste it in your browser’s URL bar, making sure to add http://localhost/ before the path. For example:
http://localhost/Shopping%20Mart/index.php

Make sure both Apache and MySQL are running in your XAMPP Control Panel before accessing the site.
